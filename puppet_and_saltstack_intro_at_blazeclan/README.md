The demo
--------

For the demo, I used 3 vagrant machines as described in the demo slide.
You can setup them using the Vagrantfile in *demo/* directory.
Unfortunately, I have setup Salt and Puppet manually on all machines, so you will have to do that manually.
I might add those files if I get some time.

Reading material
----------------
Inside *puppet/* and *salt/* directories, you will find good reading material that I used while making this presentation.
