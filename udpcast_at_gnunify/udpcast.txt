udpcast - setting up a lab en-masse.

* Problem 
	To setup a whole lab of N machines in one go.
		- To install the OS(es) and multiple application software.
	All the machines have same hardware configuration (HDD,CPU, Motherboard, etc).
	
* Solution
	udpcast over PXE
	Requirements:
		1. A template machine = one single machine configured with whatever you want.
		2. A network with all the lab machines connected to it.
		3. A seperate machine which will 'host' udpcast.
		4. All lab machines with network booting capability.

* A bit about udpcast:
	UDPcast is a file transfer tool that can send data simultaneously to many destinations on a LAN.
	Released under GNU GPL 2.0, parts under BSD-like license.
	
* Steps
	A. Setup PXE
		1.Setup TFTP Server.
		2.Setup DHCP.
	B. Setup udpcast over PXE.
		1.Install udpcast packages.
		2.Build up your initrd from udpcast.linux.lu
		3.Pick up a linux kernel.
		4.Make initrd and kernel available through the TFTP server.
		5.Write a default configuration file and place it inside the directory (ref: syslinux.org)
	C. Use it!
		1.Boot up all the lab machines over network in recieve mode.
		2.Boot up the template machine over network in sender mode.
		3.Start!
* Tips
	A. Speed.
		1.Zerofill your hard disk.
		2.Tweak your switch.
		 i)Enable IGMP snooping.
		ii)Disable Broadcast Storm Control.
		
* Some problems you might face:
	A. Transfer stops in midst:
		1. Might happen due to bad sectors on the template machine.
		2. Switch problem.
